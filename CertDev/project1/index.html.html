    <p>Nikola Tesla was an inventor who is responsible for roughly 80% of the technology we use today.  Through innovations of the technologies he developed, we're able to live in as much security and safety that we do.  Tesla was born in 1856 Croatia, Russia and lived until 1943, where he met his demise in The New Yorker, NY.  There is much to know about Nikola Tesla, and there will always be a way to <a target="_blank" id="tribute-link" href="https://www.biography.com/inventor/nikola-tesla">find the information.</a></p>

  <div id="timeline-info">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>1856:</strong> Nikola Tesla is believed to have been born at midnight. 
        During his birth, lightning struck during a summer storm. Born to a Serbian Family 
        in Smiljan, Tesla was nicknamed `Child of the Storm`, by his aunt. That said, his mother
        replied to that comment by calling him `Child of the light`. He was born based on the 
        conventional Slavonic rites, and his birth records show he was born on July 28th. Tesla
        was the fourth child in a family of five children. The family comprised of three 
        sisters including Marica, Angelina, Milka and his old brother who was known as Dane. 
        Dane died when Tesla was still at a tender age. Tesla attended his early education 
        in 1861 in Smiljan, where he acquired various skills including arithmetic and he also
        mastered the German Language. The following year, Nikola Tesla moved to a place known as 
        Gospic. Here, his father played the role of a Parish Pastor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1875:</strong> Tesla Enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic
        In 1875, Tesla began to study engineering at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria.
        He claimed to have graduated, but the institution disagrees.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1882:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li> In 1882, he went to work for Continental Edison in Paris. He was attempting to
          improve on electrical equipment sent from the United States.</li>
          <li> Working independently, Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle. 
          This is used today in alternators.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1884:</strong> Tesla moved to the United States in 1884, immediately approaching 
        Thomas Edison with a letter of introduction. According to Tesla, he was offered 50,000 
        dollars to deliver 24 different types of standard machines, but Edison never paid.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1886:</strong> Tesla founded the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company in 
        Rahway, New Jersey. He invented and marketed an arc lamp; however, he earned relatively 
        little off of his investment.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1887:</strong> The War of Currents began in 1887. Direct current, invented and 
        supported by Edison, was in direct competition with Tesla's alternating current.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1891:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li> In 1891, Tesla patented the Tesla Coil. The Tesla Coil is a resonant transformer 
          circuit that produced a high voltage, low current and high frequency alternating current 
          electricity.</li>
          <li> With the support of the Westinghouse Company, Tesla's alternating current powered the
          World's Columbian Exhibition. Tesla had offered a lower cost electrical solution.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1901:</strong> In 1901, construction began on the Wardenclyffe Tower. Tesla believed 
        that he could transmit electrical energy over long distances wirelessly, and the tower would
        illustrate that. The project was never fully completed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1914:</strong> On August 4, 1915, Tesla filed suit against Guglielmo Marconi. 
        Marconi is typically credited with radio transmission; however, Tesla accomplished this 
        before Marconi.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1934:</strong> In 1934, the New York Times published Tesla's particle beam research. 
        While he was not financially successful, he continued to be a relatively prominent voice in 
        the scientific community.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1943:</strong> On January 7, 1943, as World War II raged, Nikola Tesla 
        died in the hotel he made his home. Upon his death, the U.S. government immediately seized 
        his papers and research.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1960:</strong> In 1960, the scientific community recognized Tesla's achievements by 
        defining a Tesla as a unit of measurement. A Tesla is a unit of magnetic field B.
